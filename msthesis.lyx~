\begin_layout Abstract
Unmanned areial arcraft known as quadcopters, or quadrotors have the ability
 to vertically takeoff and move various axis of freedom with good precision
 and stablity.
 Many situations occur in which there is a need for some type of explanatory
 effort required for a large area that may be inaccessible to humans such
 as nuclear power plants, or disaster areas.
 A quadrotor swarm is attractive for these applications because it proposes
 a method to autonomously share mission information between all of the participa
ting quadrotors and collaboratively complete a task.
 This allows an autonomous quadrotor swarm to perform tasks quickly when
 compared to manual operating quadrotors.
 Current research in quadrotor swarm algorithms does not take into account
 inaccessible or remote evnironments.
 Those swarms require the use of a stationary, remote coordination platform
 that tracks the position of the swarm and facilitate swarm coordination
 from a distance.
 This requires the swarm to be within line-of-sight of the remote coordinator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The research presented in this thesis aims to add more deployment and operation
 flexibility to a quadrotor swarm through the use of a de-centralized coordinati
on algorithm in a wireless environment and a pre-exisiting on-board vision
 system.
 The constructed de-centralized coordination algorithm provides a method
 to track the position of all participating quadrotors, maintain the geometric
 integrity of the swarm through coordinating specific movement commands
 to the followers, establishes a method to uniformly move the swarm to a
 desired posiiton, and provide situational awareness to the swarm through
 collision detection.

\begin_layout Section
Research Motivation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quadrotor swarm is advantageous in situations where an explanatory effort
 is required for a large area.
 For example, a large natural disaster area that requires surveying for
 damage analysis would benefit from a swarm of quadrotors that autonomously
 collaborate with each other in order to sweep a large area in a quick timeframe.
 Also with a quadrotor swarm, the information that the participating quadrotors
 can be shared within the swarm so that simple decisions can be made without
 human interference, for example, a participating quadrotor notifies the
 swarm that a certain sector within a survey region has been explored already,
 thus allowing for the swarm to move to the next sector without the wasted
 costs of re surveying a previous sector.
 Another benefit of quadrotor swarms lies within the robust nature of the
 swarm system.
 With a singular quadrotor, the exploratory mission is compromised when
 the quadrotor is terminated (due to depletion of power supply, various
 environmental influences,etc.).
 Therefore the success of the objective is influenced by the lifetime of
 quadrotor node.
 In comparison, the lifetime of a quadrotor swarm is influenced by the number
 active nodes within the swarm.
 Typically the integrity of the mission is not compromised until all quadrotor
 participants within the swarm are terminated.
 This allows quadrotor swarms to behave in a robust manner in where they
 can still perform a mission even in the presence of terminated or damaged
 quadrotor nodes.

\begin_layout Section
Research Contribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research establishs a framework that can establish a de-centralized
 swarm algorithm.
 This is achieved through establishing the swarm coordination process on
 the swarm itself, which is referred to as a de-centralized quadrotor swarm.
 This de-centralized quadrotor swarm is realized through two main aspects
 that must be present.
 An onboard vision system that resides on participating quadrotor platforms
 in the swarm, and a swarm algorithm that is implem ented within the swarm
 itself.
 The vision system allows the participating quadrotors to establish their
 position in respect to the center of the swarm.
 The swarm algorithm is a communication based algorithm that accepts position
 data from all participating quadrotors and assigns the approiate movement
 commands.
 The swarm algorithm is necessary in establishing situational awareness
 for each participating quadrotor, and coordinating vectorized movements
 for the entire swarm.
 The swarm algorithim, or coordination process resides in a master quadrotor
 platform that is designated as the coordinator.
 The other participating quadrotors are designated as followers, and receive
 movement commands from the coordinator in respect to the current position
 that the follower advertises to the coordinator.
 The position data that the follower coordinators are in respect to the
 coordinator.
 For scalability, there may be multiple coordinators within a large swarm,
 in where each coordinator is responsible for its own area, or cluster.
 The coordinator at the lowest cluster (the first cluste established) will
 communicate movement vector commands to the rest of the swarm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contributions of this research is the establishment of the de-centralized
 swarm algorithm/ swarm coordination process that issues movement commands
 based on a existing vision system that reports a position of a quadrotor
 based on its orientation to a beacon, obstacle dection within the swarm
 for early obstacle advoidance protocol, a process for swarm maintence within
 the swarm, and a framework to communicate with an existing quadrotor flight
 controller in order so that the quadrotor can carry out movement commands
 issued by the swarm algorithm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These contributions are advantegous in the sense that a de-centralized swarm
 algorithm will gurantee a more flexible swarm deployement in where the
 swarm is not confined to a certain area.
 This allows the swarm to approach more versatile missions such as survelliance
 in a environment non accessible to humans.

Quadrotor Platform Overview 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quadrotor platforms are unmanned aerial vehicles that are composed of four
 rotating propellers.
 The four rotating propellers allow the quad rotor platform to sustain lift,
 and perform various aerial maneuvers with more precision when compared
 to a conventional helicopter platforms.
 With the capability of performing precise aerial movements combined with
 a relatively small frame structure, and low production costs, quadrotor
 platforms are attractive for hobbyist, surveillance, and payload manipulation.
 In the commercial industry, interest for quadrotor platforms is prevalent.
 DHL is such a company that has pursed the potential benefits of using quadrotor
 platforms for payload manipulation as seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 .
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DHL-Quadrotor-Unmanned"

\end_inset

, these quadrotor platforms are capable of light payload manipulation that
 can be served as payload transportation and package deliveries.

In construction, quadrotor platforms are attractive for land surveying and
 mapping.
 When equipped with the appropriate sensor platform, such as LIDAR
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LIDAR"

\end_inset

 , land mapping can be efficient and fast due to the aerial maneuverability
 of the quadrotor platform and its ability to travel across an area relatively
 quickly when compared to conventional techniques for land surveying/mapping.
 Although a singular quad rotor is capable of performing the previously
 mentioned tasks of surveillance/land mapping and payload manipulation effective
ly, having multiple quadrotors autonomously collaborate together in order
 to achieve these tasks enhances efficiency, speed of execution, higher
 resilience to human error, and robustness.
 Quadrotor swarms also enables the use of particular applications that cannot
 be practically realized with a single quadrotor platform.
 One such application is the implementation of an Ad Hoc telecommunication
 network coverage area for disaster areas.
 Proposed by M.Sakti Alvissalim in

, quadrotor swarms can be outfitted in such a way in where each participating
 quadrotor provides certain coverage of an area, similar to a cellular site.
 Communication links are maintained within the swarm in order to establish
 end-to-end communication link from the client to the access point to the
 back bone network.

Quadrotor Platform Dynamic Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quadrotor is a unmanned arieal vehicle with four rotors.
 In most quadrotor applications, the rotors on the quadrotor platform are
 brushless electric motors.
 Each rotor produces torque, which in turn produces thrust for the quadrotor
 platform.
 The higher the angular velocity of the rotor, the more thrust the rotor
 will produce.
 Certain combinations of angular velocities of the rotors will generte main
 thrust, pitch torque, and roll torque for the quadrotor

Typical motors used within a quadrotor platform are brushless, electric
 motors that can be controlled by Electronic Speed Controllers(
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

).
 Electronic Speed controllers are advanategous for motor control because
 they offer a method to regulate the amount of power transferred to the
 motor.
 An ESC interprets a Pulse Width Modulation(
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

) signal as an input that controls the amount of power transmitted to the
 motor and ultimately dictates the angular velocity of the motor.
 The higher angular velocity of the motor will correlate to a higher amount
 of thrust generated by the respective rotor.
 ESCs are also capable of regulating the amount of voltage.
 The ESC receives PWM control signals from an on-board Radio Frequency(

The general operation of the swarm of micro quadrotors constructed by GRASP
 laboratory, is based on a centralized coordination scheme.
 In GRASP laboratory's centralized coordination scheme, a fixed vision system
 that uses a Vicon motion capture system , senses the position of all participan
ts within the swarm.
 The fixed vision system then streams position data of the participating
 quadrotors to a base station via gigabit ethernet which in turn determines
 the appropriate swarm coordination.
 The base station uses a MATLAB based process that coordinates movements
 within the swarm from processing the received position data of the fixed
 vision system, and developing respective movement commands for each participati
ng quadrotor.
 Movement commands are issued to the participating quadrotors every 10 milliseco
nds.Once the movement command is constructed for the appropriate participating
 quadrotor, the base station transmits the command to that quadrotor.

 work simutaenously to complete a single task.
 A team comprises of two or more groups that collaborate to complete an
 overall objective by completeting parallel subtasks

.
 The research assumes that participants within the group have the ability
 to communicate at higher data rates with lower latencies when compared
 to the communication established between groups.

Experimental testing was done with four quadrotors following a certain trajector
y.
 The performance of the trajectory following was characterized through comparing
 the actual position of the quadrotors and the desired position of the quadrotor
s.

The main strengths of the research proposed by GRASP laboratory are that
 the centralized coordination scheme allows for precise arieal maneuvers
 with high agility, and that swarm formations can be constructed with realitve
 ease.
 The major drawback of the centralized coordination scheme is that the resulting
 swarm is confined to a certain region due to its dependence on an external
 vision system and base station as shown in Figure
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 This diminishes the flexibility of deployement for the swarm, thus limiting
 its applications.
 Therefore, there is a tradeoff for agility and speed of swarm formation
 with deployement flexibility.
